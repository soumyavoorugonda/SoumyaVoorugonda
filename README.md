## 👋 Hey, I’m Soumya

I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning ideas into working systems.

Right now, I’m building products at startups Veach AI and VeriTX, and experimenting with small side projects to learn something new every week.

Tech I use: Python, TypeScript, React, FastAPI, Next.js, AWS, PostgreSQL, Docker.

If you want to chat about projects, AI systems, or just building cool stuff, I’m always open to connect.
